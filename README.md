# The Science of Decisions :bulb:

* In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 
* I will analyse, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I will interpret my findings in terms of [statistical hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing).

### _[My Report](https://ashish25.github.io/P1-StroopEffect/)_

### Accessing the Analysis :key:

You can access and edit the result of the analysis by accessing the notebook available via IPython Notebook through these steps:
1. If you have not installed IPython in your computer, you can install it by using [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) by running `conda install ipython && conda install notebook` on your terminal or clicking at anaconda link. choose the installer that runs with **Python version 2.7**
3. From your terminal, go to the directory or folder of this project where you can find the file of `dand_stroop_effect.ipynb`
4. Run ipython notebook `dand_stroop_effect.ipynb` in your terminal. IPython Notebook will be opened in your default browser and you can access and edit the notebook.
